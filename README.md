# 🧠 PixelSort — Visual Sorting Algorithm Playground

PixelSort is an interactive web application that turns sorting algorithms into a visual puzzle game.

Users can upload any image, slice it into tiles, shuffle it, and watch various sorting algorithms **reconstruct the original image** — step by step. It's perfect for both education and visual learners who want to see how sorting works under the hood.

## 🎯 Features

- 🖼️ **Image-Based Visualization**  
  Upload an image and slice it into a grid (e.g., 4x4). Each tile is treated as a data element to be sorted.

- 🔄 **Supported Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort

- 🎛️ **Step-by-Step Analysis**  
  Watch every step of the sorting process — comparisons, swaps, and logic explained in real time.

- ⚖️ **Side-by-Side Comparison Mode**  
  Visually compare two algorithms on the same shuffled image and see which is faster or more efficient.

- 📊 **Stats Panel**  
  See live updates for:
  - Number of steps
  - Comparisons
  - Swaps
  - Execution time
  - Time complexity and pseudocode

- ✨ **Highlights & Animation**  
  Active tiles are highlighted during sorting and animated when swapped, bringing clarity and flair to each algorithm.

- 🎨 **GSAP-Powered UI Animations**  
  Smooth transitions, hover effects, and visual polish using GreenSock Animation Platform.

- 🌐 **Responsive & Themed UI**  
  Fully styled interface using a bold color palette and a universal navbar for navigation.
